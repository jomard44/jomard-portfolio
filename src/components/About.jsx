      <p className="text-gray-700/70 leading-relaxed">
        I’m a second-year IT Web Programming student at NSCC with a strong
        interest in full-stack development. I enjoy building real-world
        applications and improving my problem-solving skills.
        <br /><br />
        Recently, I’ve been working on projects like a job tracking system and a
        gym management app, where I focus on building clean APIs and connecting
        frontend and backend effectively.
        <br /><br />
        I’m currently looking for an opportunity where I can
        contribute and grow as a developer.
